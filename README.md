# game_of_life
Build Week for Lambda School - Conway's Game of Life

## What is the project?

### Objective

- Create a unique, high quality implementation of Conway's Game of Life using JavaScript and React
- Understand and communicate the rules of Conway's Game of Life
- Understand what cellular automata are and describe how they are useful in real life
- Correctly analyze the ‘Turing Completeness’ of Conway’s “Game of Life”
- Utilize "double buffering" to implement the game

### What problem does it solve?

- Visualization of an important piece of programming history.

### Stand out difficulties and solutions

- Double buffering was a new concept for me. I utilized the 'immer' library so that I could mutate a copy
    of the data, then proceed to change the actual state when the copy was complete.

### TODO list/wishlist. What would I add if I had more time?

- I would add more presets for the user to choose from, as well as adding ways for the user to change the
    visual appearance(i.e. colors). I would also like to add the ability to 'jump' to different generations, 
    so the user could see the end result without having to wait for the game to play to that point.
    
### Status

- Complete, but with a lot of space for growth

### Deployment

- Deployed via Netlify at: https://awesome-ramanujan-7d7ef5.netlify.app/
