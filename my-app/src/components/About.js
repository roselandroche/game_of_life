What is it?
It is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in 1970. It is a 0 player game - aside from the 
    initial configuration no user input is required. The state changes and evolves on its own.
It is composed of a grid of cells that follow rules from which complex behaviors can emerge.

Why is it useful?
This can be used in simulations for biological or chemical or other scenarios, to assist in research.

How is Turing Completeness related?
A computing system is Turing Complete if it is capable of performing arbitrary, general purpose computation.
    Conway's Game of Life is a computing system that qualifies.

What are the rules?
    Birth?
        If the current cell is dead, but 3 neighboring cells are alive, it comes to life.
    Death?
        If the current cell is alive, it needs 2 to 3 living neighboring cells to survive, else it dies.
